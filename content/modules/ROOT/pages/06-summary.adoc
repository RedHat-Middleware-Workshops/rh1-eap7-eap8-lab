== Workshop summary

In this workshop we've completed the migration of a JBoss EAP 7.4 application to JBoss EAP 8.0.  We've then deployed this application on OpenShift.
We've use Red Hat Service Interconnect to create a connection between a legacy SOAP service running on a virtual machine and an OpenShift namespace.
Finally, we've taken a Red Hat Fuse application and migrated this to Red Hat build of Apache Camel for Quarkus. This application has also been migrated to OpenShift.

The resulting architecture should resemble our desired end-state:
