## Verify the Service Interconnect network
At this point you can verify that the service network is actually working as expected.

. Make sure you are on the OCP terminal

. Make sure you are on the `rh1-lab-eap-camel-quarkus` folder
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
pwd
----

. Output
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
/projects/rh1-lab-eap-camel-quarkus
----

. Navigate to the `soap1` folder
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
cd migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/base/camelq/stubs/soap1
----

. Send a request to the soap service. Observe that the URL that you are using is local OpenShift service and not any external route exposed to the public internet
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
curl -s -d @src/main/resources/request.xml http://soap-api.user1-project.svc.cluster.local:8080/services/s1 | xmllint --format -
----

. If our Service Interconnect network was setup correctly you should be able to see a response as shown below

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>

Congratulations! You built a secure service network between services on two different environments and allowed applications to connect and communicate over the secure network using Red Hat Service Interconnect.
