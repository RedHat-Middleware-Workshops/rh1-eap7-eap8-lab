= Test driven SOAP integration

We now focus attention to the integration with the SOAP endpoint.

## 1. Migrate SOAP endpoint

Still following a test-driven approach, include the checks below in your JUnit:

. Find in your _Camel Quarkus_ project the region of code with the following declaration:
+
----
    @Test
    public void testServiceGetDetails() throws Exception{

        MockEndpoint rest = getMockEndpoint("mock:backend-rest"); 
        rest.expectedMessageCount(1);

        // COPY/PASTE HERE SOAP MOCK <1>

        ...
----
+

======
<1> This is the placeholder where to keep hold of the embedded SOAP mock.
======

. Include the following code where it says `COPY/PASTE HERE SOAP MOCK`:
+
[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
        //set Mock expectations
        MockEndpoint soap = getMockEndpoint("mock:backend-soap");  // <1>
        soap.expectedMessageCount(1);                              // <2>
----
+
.Click here to reveal notes
[%collapsible]
======
<1> Uses Camel's testing framework to obtain the SOAP Mock endpoint.
<2> Sets the expectation on the Mock it should receive a request from _Camel_.
======

. Scroll to the botton of the `testServiceGetDetails()` test unit and include the following code where it says `COPY/PASTE HERE SOAP checks`:
+
[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
        //obtain request sent to SOAP backend
        org.example.s1.SubscriberRequest soapMessage = 
                soap.getExchanges().get(0).getIn().getBody(org.example.s1.SubscriberRequest.class);

        //validate request to SOAP backend
        assertNotNull(soapMessage, "something is wrong.");  // <1>
        assertEquals("123", soapMessage.getId(), "oh oh");  // <2>

        // COPY/PASTE HERE JSON response checks <3>
----

======
The code is the same as the original in _Fuse_, except for minor JUnit 5 version differences:

<1> The `assertNotNull` invocation is the same except JUnit 5 defines the message argument in last position instead of first.
<2> The `assertEquals` also defines the message argument in last position instead of first.
<3> Leave this slot for later. +
The assertions to validate the final JSON response will be added later in the lab.

    @Test
    public void testServiceGetDetails() throws Exception{

        ...

        //obtain request sent to SOAP backend
        org.example.s1.SubscriberRequest soapMessage = 
                soap.getExchanges().get(0).getIn().getBody(org.example.s1.SubscriberRequest.class);

        //validate request to SOAP backend
        assertNotNull(soapMessage, "something is wrong.");
        assertEquals("123", soapMessage.getId(), "oh oh");

        ...
----
======

The new changes in the JUnit are introducing checks to validate SOAP functionality that hasn't been migrated yet.

If you run the unit test again with:

```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

Again, not surprisingly, you should see your test unit fail with the following error message:
----
[ERROR] Failures: 
[ERROR]   ServiceTest.testServiceGetDetails:97 mock://backend-soap Received message count. Expected: <1> but was: <0>
[INFO] 
[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] 
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD FAILURE
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

The error above is telling you the mock (SOAP) server never got called by _Camel_. This is obvious, as the _Camel_ route invoking the SOAP backend is still missing (not migrated).

## 2. Migrate the first route

Let's migrate the necessary code from _Fuse_ so that the JUnit succeeds.

There are 2 _Camel_ routes dedicated to integrate with the SOAP endpoint:

* `<route id="call-system2">` +
Contains the processing steps to interact with the SOAP server
* `<route id="json2soap">` +
Converts the JSON request into a SOAP request



Open in _Camel Quarkus_ the file containing the _Camel_ definitions, located at:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/main/resources/routes/api-medium.xml*

. Find in your template the following definition (empty):
+
----
    <route id="call-system2">
      <from uri="direct:call-system2"/>
      <!-- COPY/PASTE SYSTEM2 DEFINITION HERE -->
      <log message="dummy call-system2 (to be removed)"/>
    </route>
----
+
Replace the line `<!-- COPY/PASTE SYSTEM2 DEFINITION HERE -->` with the snippet below:
+
[source,xml,role="copypaste"]
----
      <!-- TRANSFORM REQUEST JSON-to-SOAP -->
      <to uri="direct:json2soap"/>

      <!-- CALL to BACKEND -->
      <removeHeaders pattern="*"/>
      <setHeader name="CamelDestinationOverrideUrl">                <!-- 1 -->
        <simple>http://{{api.backend2.host}}/services/s1</simple>
      </setHeader>
      <to id="end2" uri="cxf:bean:s1"/>

      <!-- UNWRAPS CXF RESPONSE (CXF delivers array) -->
      <setBody>
        <simple>${body[0]}</simple>
      </setBody>

      <!-- KEEP RESPONSE -->
      <setProperty name="subscriber-response-soap">                 <!-- 2 -->
        <simple resultType="String">${body}</simple>
      </setProperty>

      <log message="Backend2 is: ${exchangeProperty.subscriber-response-soap}"/>

----
    <route id="call-system2">
      <from uri="direct:call-system2"/>

      <!-- TRANSFORM REQUEST JSON-to-SOAP -->
      <to uri="direct:json2soap"/>

      <!-- CALL to BACKEND -->
      <removeHeaders pattern="*"/>
      <setHeader headerName="CamelDestinationOverrideUrl">
        <simple>http://{{api.backend2.host}}/services/s1</simple>
      </setHeader>
      <to id="end2" uri="cxf:bean:s1"/>

      <!-- UNWRAPS CXF RESPONSE (CXF delivers array) -->
      <setBody>
      	<simple>${body[0]}</simple>
      </setBody>

      <!-- KEEP RESPONSE -->
      <setProperty propertyName="subscriber-response-soap">
        <simple resultType="String">${body}</simple>
      </setProperty>

      <log message="Backend2 is: ${exchangeProperty.subscriber-response-soap}"/>
    </route>
----
======

In summary, the migrated _Camel_ route performs the following actions:

. *Transforms the incoming client JSON request into SOAP*.
. *Prepares and triggers the call to the SOAP backend*.
. *Unwraps the SOAP response*.
. *Keeps the response in a process variable (Exchange property)*.

The implemented interaction with the SOAP backend is illustrated in the sub-diagram shown below:

## 3. Migrate the second route

Let's migrate now the second route. +
Find in your template the following definition (empty):
----
    <route id="json2soap">
      <from uri="direct:json2soap"/>
      <!-- COPY/PASTE SOAP DEFINITION HERE -->
      <log message="dummy"/>
    </route>
----

. Replace the line `<!-- COPY/PASTE SOAP DEFINITION HERE -->` with the snippet below:
+
[source,xml,role="copypaste"]
----
      <!-- SET ORIGINAL JSON REQUEST -->
      <setHeader name="json">                            <!-- 1 -->
        <simple>${exchangeProperty.request}</simple>
      </setHeader>

      <!-- SET DUMMY XSLT INPUT (real input comes from header 'json') -->
      <setBody>
        <simple>&lt;data/&gt;</simple>                   <!-- 2 -->
      </setBody>

      <!-- TRANSFORM REQUEST JSON-to-SOAP -->            <!-- 3 -->
      <to uri="xslt-saxon:xslt/request.xsl"/>            <!-- 4 -->
----

[%collapsible]
======
In the snippet above the following migration changes have been applied to the original _Blueprint_ code.

<1> `setHeader` replaces the old `setBody`.
+
NOTE: The new code directly injects JSON into the XSLT (as a header `json`). The old code did not use native JSON handling and required some pre-processing.
<2> Although unused during XSLT processing in favour of the `json` header, the body is set with dummy `<data/>` because XSLT requires non-empty XML input.
<3> Because XSLT 3.0 can natively handle JSON in _Camel_ 4 , we can discard the pre-processing `direct:json2xml` route needed in the old _Fuse_ code.
<4> The old _Camel_ component in _Fuse_ `xslt` (saxon) becomes `xslt-saxon` in the new version of _Camel_.
+
NOTE: the XSLT itself consequently requires migration changes as well (covered later in the lab).

----
    <route id="json2soap">
      <from uri="direct:json2soap"/>

      <!-- SET ORIGINAL JSON REQUEST -->
      <setBody>
        <simple>${exchangeProperty.request}</simple>
      </setBody>

      <!-- TRANSFORM REQUEST JSON-to-SOAP -->
      <to uri="direct:json2xml"/>                   <1>
      <to uri="xslt:xslt/request.xsl?saxon=true"/>
    </route>
----

<1> Because XSLT 3.0 can natively handle JSON in _Camel_ 4 , we can discard the pre-processing `direct:json2xml` route needed in the old Fuse code.
======

In summary, the migrated _Camel_ route executes the following actions:

. *Prepares the JSON input (as a header) for the XSLT*.
. *Executes the `request.xsl` stylesheet to transform JSON into SOAP*.

{empty} +

## 4. Update XSLT transformation

One last migration step is to update the XSLT transformation to use native JSON handling with XPATH 3.0.

NOTE: Although XSLT 3.0 was supported in _Fuse_, the old _Saxon_ dependency version required an enterprise licence. This is not a problem in _Red Hat build of Apache Camel_.


Open in _Camel Quarkus_ the following XSLT definition:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/main/resources/xslt/request.xsl*

Follow these instructions

. Replace the line `<!-- COPY/UPDATE mapping here -->` with the snippet below:
+
[source,xml,role="copypaste"]
----
	<!-- Helper template to convert JSON into XML
		 as per: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#json-to-xml-mapping -->
	<xsl:import href="common/j2x.xsl"/>                                 <!-- 1 -->

	<!-- The actual data mapping -->
	<xsl:template match="map">                                          <!-- 2 -->
      <s1:SubscriberRequest xmlns:s1="http://www.example.org/s1/">
         <Id><xsl:value-of select="/map/string[@key='id']"/></Id>       <!-- 3 -->
      </s1:SubscriberRequest>
	</xsl:template>

----
<1> The parameter declaration where the JSON payload is injected (as a header in the _Camel_ route).
<2> The Xpath 3.0 function natively available to convert JSON into its XML representation.
========
+
NOTE: To understand better how XSLT 3.0 handles JSON natively, refer to the following specification: +
https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#json-to-xml-mapping

<2> `match="map"` replaces `match="/"`. +
This is because the new mapping works against the XML representation of the JSON structure (as per the XSLT 3.0 spec).
+
[NOTE]
--
* In _Fuse_ the input was pre-processed JSON converted into XML before executing the XSLT, hence the `match="/"` to find the root of the document.
* In contrast, in the new version, no pre-processing takes place. The input JSON like `{...}` is converted into `<map>...</map>`, hence the `match="map"`
--

<3> The `select` expression uses `/map/string[]` to find the node from the XML representation of JSON. In _Fuse_ the expression just looked for the `id` node from the pre-processed XML structure.

## 5. SOAP endpoint reconfiguration

Almost there. +
Before executing one more time the Junit to validate the latest migration changes, let's add in the test unit the SOAP endpoint reconfiguration to point to the embedded mock SOAP.

Edit again the test unit in your _Camel Quarkus_ project:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/test/java/org/camel/example/ServiceTest.java*

And follow the steps indicated below:

. Find in your _Camel Quarkus_ project the region of code with the following declaration:
+
----
    private void reconfigureEndpoints() throws Exception {
        ...

        // COPY/PASTE HERE SOAP reconfiguration       
    }
----

. Include the following code where it says `COPY/PASTE HERE SOAP ...`:
+
[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
        //reconfigure SOAP endpoint <1>
        AdviceWith.adviceWith(context, "call-system2", a -> {
          a.weaveById("end2").before()
           .setHeader("CamelDestinationOverrideUrl").simple(host+"/services/s1");
        });
----
+
.Click here to reveal notes
[%collapsible]
======
<1> The `AdviceWith` directive ensures the random port is used when calling the SOAP mock server.
======

You have now completed the integration with the SOAP endpoint (and configured the Junit) in order to call the SOAP backend and obtain a response.

Rerun the test unit with:

```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

While earlier the Junit was failing to validate the SOAP implementation, now it should pass and the following message should show:
----
...
[INFO] Results:
[INFO] 
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

----

Your Junit now succeeds to validate the following requirements:

* Successfully call the exposed REST service `/camel/subscriber/details`
* The main route calls the `call-system1` sub-route.
* The `call-system1` route prepares and sends a REST request.
* The REST mock server receives the JSON request.
* The JUnit captures the backend JSON request and validates its payload.
* The `call-system2` route prepares and sends a SOAP request.
* The SOAP mock server receives the SOAP request.
* The JUnit captures the backend SOAP request and validates its payload.
