== Migrate the service

Both _Fuse_ and _Camel_ on _Quarkus_ are _Java_ projects based on _Maven_. Aside from packaging differences, their general structure is very similar and migrating files from one to the other is relatively easy.

NOTE: The degree of difficulty to migrate a project will obviously vary depending on the complexity and coding practices of the original source code.

Commonly, a Camel integration project involves the following resources:

- *Integration flows*: _Camel_ routes in XML/Java code
- *Java*: for custom functionality.
- *API contracts*: WSDLs/OpenAPI interfaces
- *Data mappings*: XSLTs/Java
- *Test units*: Java

NOTE: In a case by case basis, projects with different needs may additionally require other type of resources, like database schemas, SQL scripts, protocol schemas, templates, properties, etc.

The _Fuse_ project to migrate in this lab contains the common elements above described, and was implemented following best coding practices at the time available.

Nonetheless, the migration offers opportunities to improve/modernise coding practices and adopt new standards.

### Working on the Camel Quarkus project

You typically start a _Camel on Quarkus_ project by creating a project skeleton. The {quarkus-code-generator} is a great place where to start. You can use its search filter to automatically display all the _Apache Camel_ extensions available for _Quarkus_.

This lab however already includes a pre-generated skeleton you will use to complete the migration. It will accelerate the work and help minimise human factor mistakes during the migration exercises.

NOTE: The pre-generated skeleton is located in `migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template`

Inspect the list below for a summary of the files in the project you need to work on:

. New resources:
- *openapi.json* (REST definition using the OpenApi standard)
- *Routes.java* (Where the CXF SOAP endpoint is defined)
- *j2x.xsl* (XSLT with out-of-the-box JSON to XML transformer)
. Migrated resources:
- *api-medium.xml* (Camel XML routes)
- *request.xsl* / *response.xsl* (XSLT mappings)
- *application.properties* (configuration)
- *ServiceTest.java* (JUnit)
. Copied resources:
- *s1.wsdl* (SOAP service definition)
- *response.json* (Unit test sample)
- *response.xml*  (Unit test sample)

{empty} +

### Migrate the Blueprint XML files

The best place in a _Fuse_ project from where to start migrating code is from the Blueprint definitions.

[NOTE]
-- 
* In the sections below, we only cover the code blocks in the _Blueprint_ files we need to migrate. +
* Other blocks are discarded because they are _Karaf_-specific and not needed in _Camel Quarkus_.
--

All the _Blueprint_ definitions are located in the _Fuse_ project under the folder:

 - *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/base/karaf/level2medium-soap/src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/*

{empty} +

#### Configuration

When looking at the first code block from the `configuration.xml` blueprint file you'll find the configuration properties needed for _Karaf_ deployments:
--
  <cm:property-placeholder persistent-id="demo.medium" id="demo.medium">
  <cm:default-properties>
      <cm:property name="rest.host" value="localhost"/>
      <cm:property name="rest.port" value="20000"/>
      <cm:property name="api.backend1.host" value="localhost:10000"/>
      <cm:property name="api.backend1.path" value="/camel/subscriber/details"/>
      <cm:property name="api.backend2.host" value="localhost:9000"/>
  </cm:default-properties>
  </cm:property-placeholder>
--

From the properties above we can discard `rest.host` and `rest.port` because they define a dedicated (private) port in a _Karaf_ container shared with other applications. In _Quarkus_ we use the default server port because the _Camel_ project fully owns the running instance (unlike _Karaf_ running multiple bundles). 

In a _Quarkus_ project, all the configuration is located in the `application.properties` file.

Open the file in your _Camel Quarkus_ project:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/main/resources/application.properties*

And follow the steps indicated below:

. Find the region of code with the following declaration:
+
----
# COPY PASTE HERE ENDPOINTS CONFIGURATION
----

. Replace the line above with the following configuration:
+
[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
# REST Backend configuration
      api.backend1.host = eap8:8080
      api.backend1.path = /subscribers
# JUnits and Local testing configuration
 %dev.api.backend1.host = localhost:10000
%test.api.backend1.path = /unit/test/subscriber/details

# SOAP Backend configuration
      api.backend2.host = end2:8080
# JUnits and Local testing configuration
 %dev.api.backend2.host = localhost:9000
%test.api.backend2.host = localhost:{{quarkus.http.test-port}}

# Quarkus test port randomly allocated
quarkus.http.test-port=0
----

NOTE: You'll notice the last line defines `quarkus.http.test-port=0` which indicates to _Quarkus_ to randomly allocate the port to use as the system's entrypoint. We'll discuss this point later in the lab during unit testing. 

[NOTE]
--
In _Quarkus_ you can easily define values for different environments by simply using environment prefixes:

- The `%dev.` prefix defines values when running in developer mode.
- The `%test.` prefix defines values when running Junits (test mode).
--

{empty} +

#### SOAP endpoint (CXF definition)

The next relevant block from the `cxf.xml` blueprint file (in _Fuse_) is the CXF endpoint definition, as shown below:
--
  <camelcxf:cxfEndpoint 
     id="s1"
     address="http://${api.backend2.host}/services/s1"
     serviceClass="org.example.s1.S1">
    <camelcxf:properties>
      <entry key="dataFormat" value="PAYLOAD"/>
    </camelcxf:properties>
  </camelcxf:cxfEndpoint>
--

In _Camel Quarkus_ projects you can also define _CXF_ endpoints in XML, but using Bean XML definitions instead of _Blueprint_ constructs.

The equivalent XML bean for _Camel_ is shown below. Copy the properties from the snippet below and paste them in the _Camel_ XML resource in your _Camel Quarkus_ project.

Open the following file in your _Camel Quarkus_ project:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/main/resources/routes/api-medium.xml*

And follow the instructions below:

. Find the region of code with the following declaration:
+
----
    <!-- SOAP Endpoint -->
    <bean name="s1" type="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxws.CxfEndpoint">

      <!-- COPY/PASTE PROPERTIES HERE -->

    </bean>
----

. Replace the line `COPY/PASTE PROPERTIES HERE` with:
+
[source,xml,role="copypaste"]
----
      <properties>
        <property key="serviceClass" value="org.example.s1.S1" />
        <property key="address" value="/s1" />
        <property key="dataFormat" value="PAYLOAD" />
      </properties>
----

Your CXF (SOAP) endpoint is now defined in your migrated code.

{empty} +

#### API exposure (REST entrypoint)

The next relevant block from the `camel.xml` blueprint file is the REST DSL code that defines the API operation to invoke the service, as shown below:
--
  	<restConfiguration 
  		component="netty-http"
  		host="{{rest.host}}" 
  		port="{{rest.port}}" 
  		enableCORS="true">
  	</restConfiguration>

    <rest path="/camel">
        <post consumes="application/json" id="getDetails" uri="/subscriber/details" produces="application/json">
            <param name="body" required="true" type="body"/>
            <to uri="direct:getDetails"/>
        </post>
    </rest>
--

* The `<restConfiguration>` code defines the _Camel_ component used and configurable parameters.
* The `<rest>` block defines a `<post>` operation to invoke the service. 

Although this is valid code in the latest _Camel_ version and still runnable on _Camel Quarkus_, it follows a code-first approach which is discouraged in nowadays enterprise solutions.

For the migrated service in _Quarkus_, we discard the code blocks above and define instead an _OpenApi_ contract equivalent to the POST operation and data exchange. The _OpenApi_ represents the source of truth and allows us to adopt an API-first approach (also known as contract-first).

In your _Quarkus_ project you'll find the _OpenApi_ definition under the following location:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/main/resources/META-INF/openapi.json*

NOTE: The _OpenApi_ definition provided was created with _Apicurio Studio_, a beautiful and intuitive design-time visual tool.

Instead of manually creating the REST DSL definition (code-first) we automate its generation out of the _OpenApi_ (contract-first). This automation simplifies the work by letting the developer just focus on the processing flow implementation, as illustrated in the figure below:

image::rest-autogenerated.png[align="center", width=80%]

The auto-generated code automation shown above is enabled via the configuration of a _Maven_ plugin.

Follow the steps below to configure the plugin:

--
. Open your `pom.xml` file and find the following region in the code:
+
----
<plugins>
    ...
    <!-- COPY HERE YOUR MAVEN PLUGIN TO GENERATE THE OPENAPI -->
</plugins>
----
+
. Copy and paste the Maven plugin below in your POM file:

[source,xml,role="copypaste"]
----
      <!-- 
      To enable API-first approach:
      This plugin auto-generates the Camel REST-DSL definition
      Camel loads it from the classpath -->
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-restdsl-openapi-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>4.1.0</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <id>generate-rest-dsl</id>
                <phase>generate-sources</phase>
                <goals>
                    <goal>generate-xml</goal>
                </goals>
                <configuration>
                    <specificationUri>src/main/resources/META-INF/openapi.json</specificationUri>
                    <restConfiguration>false</restConfiguration>
                    <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/classes/routes/</outputDirectory>
                </configuration>
            </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>

#### Main Camel route

Let's migrate the main _Camel_ route that contains the end-to-end flow.

Open in _Camel Quarkus_ the file containing the _Camel_ definitions, located at:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/main/resources/routes/api-medium.xml*
+
NOTE: The file is a skeleton with empty route definitions and dummy values. You will complete its definition in stages as you make progress along the lab. 

Find and replace your current definition (empty) in your Camel Project:
----
    <route id="main">
      <!-- COPY/PASTE DEFINITION HERE -->
    </route>
----

Replace the line `<!-- COPY/PASTE DEFINITION HERE -->` with the snippet below (based on the orginal _Blueprint_ definition):

[source,xml,role="copypaste"]
----
      <from uri="direct:getDetails"/>

      <convertBodyTo type="String"/>

      <!-- PRESERVE ORIGINAL REQUEST PAYLOAD -->
      <setProperty name="request">           <!-- 1 -->   
        <simple>${body}</simple>
      </setProperty>

      <!-- RESOLVE BACKEND CALLS -->
      <to uri="direct:call-system1"/>
      <to uri="direct:call-system2"/>

      <!-- TRANSFORM (COMPOSE) 2 XML RESPONSES INTO JSON -->
      <to uri="direct:mapResponse"/>

      <setHeader name="content-type">        <!-- 2 -->
        <constant>application/json</constant>
      </setHeader>
----

<route id="main">

    <convertBodyTo type="String"/>

    <!-- PRESERVE ORIGINAL REQUEST PAYLOAD -->
    <setProperty propertyName="request">
    <simple>${body}</simple>
    </setProperty>

    <!-- RESOLVE BACKEND CALLS -->
    <to uri="direct:call-system1"/>
    <to uri="direct:call-system2"/>

    <!-- TRANSFORM (COMPOSE) 2 XML RESPONSES INTO JSON -->
    <to uri="direct:mapResponse"/>

    <setHeader headerName="content-type">
    <constant>application/json</constant>
    </setHeader>
</route>
----
======

You can tell by looking at the entire _Camel_ `main` route definition that it describes very well the entire processing flow where the following key processes take place:

. *Call system 1 (REST backend)*
. *Call system 2 (SOAP backend)*
. *Map obtained data to respond*

The key processing steps above listed are well illustrated in our service diagram shown earlier:

image::camel-service.png[align="center", width=80%]

You now have covered some good ground, let's make sure the work you've done so far actually works.

Run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev
```

_Quarkus_ provides an out-of-the-box browsable UI to test your APIs. You can display the _Swagger_ UI by:

 1. Entering its URL in your browser's address bar
 2. via the dev UI (Press `D`, then click the SmallRye OpenApi tile) 

To open the _Swagger_ UI by opening the URL in a browser, enter:

 - http://localhost:8080/q/camel/openapi.json

Click on the service to try, and hit the `Try it out` button, scroll down and then click `Execute`.

Or, from your running _Camel Quarkus_ terminal, press `[d]`, it will open the dev UI in your default browser. Find the SmallRye tile, and click **Swagger UI**.

image::test-1.png[align="center", width=100%]


If successful, you should get a dummy JSON response similar to:

----
{
  "client": {
    "fullName": "dummy",
    "addressLine1": "dummy",
    "addressLine2": "dummy",
    "...
}
----

[TIP]
--
The response you're obtaining is from a dummy sample payload _Camel_ loads from the following processing action in the `mapResponse` Camel route:
----
<to uri="language:constant:resource:classpath:/data/dummy.json"/>
----
