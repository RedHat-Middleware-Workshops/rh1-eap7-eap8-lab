== Code Analysis

JBoss EAP 8.0 requires code changes to applications written for JBoss EAP 7.4. Due to the move from Jakarta 8 to Jakarta 10 (e.g. converting from the “javax” namespace to “jakarta” namespace). These changes are documented in this https://access.redhat.com/articles/6980265[article, window="_blank"]. 

== Using the Windup VS Code extension

To perform the required code changes, we're going to use the Windup VS Code extension.  

IMPORTANT: If you do not see the Windup icon on the left hand panel, refresh your browser.

Click on the Windup icon on the left hand panel.

* Ensure "eap8 and openjdk17" are selected under "--target" 

To perform the code analysis, click on the start button as shown below

Once the analysis is complete, you should see a file hierachy in the left hand window.  

At the top of the file hierarchy is a report icon (in green).  Click on this to view the HTML version of the report.

Clicking on a file will open up the editor showing where the issues are with the file.

Click on "App" in the report, and then select the "Issues" tab to view the details of the migration.
