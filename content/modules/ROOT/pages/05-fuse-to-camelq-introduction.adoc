= Lab Introduction

_Red Hat Fuse_ is a _Karaf_ (OSGI) based container to run _Apache Camel_ (and _Java_) applications. However, since the appearance of containers and _Kubernetes_ environments, the preferred approach to deliver services is by adopting micro-services architectures.

In this exercise you will undergo the process of migrating a _Red Hat Fuse_ service into a _Red Hat build of Apache Camel_ on _Quarkus_ application.

== The service

For illustration purposes, the picture below shows what the _Camel_ integration end-to-end flow looks like.

The service exposes a REST (Json) entrypoint and integrates with two backends, one is REST based, and the second endpoint is SOAP based. 

The integration represents a composition service. It obtains information from both end systems and merges the data to respond to the client request.

The service currently runs on _Red Hat Fuse_ and we want to modernise it to run on _Camel Quarkus_.
