== OpenShift Environment

Before we deploy our JBoss EAP 8.0 application on OpenShift, we need to deploy a PostgreSQL database.

Access the OpenShift console by clicking on the following {openshift_cluster_console_url}[link^] 

Login with the following credentials:

* *Username*: `{USER_ID}`
* *Password*: `openshift`

*Switch to the project called "{USER_ID}-project"*

## Deploy a PostgreSQL database

Within this project, add a PostgreSQL database by Clicking on "+Add" and selecting "Database" from the Developer catalog.

From the Developer catalog, select the "PostgreSQL" template and fill out the form details as shown below.

[source,sh]
----
* User name: postgresUser
* Password: postgresPW
* Database name: postgresDB
----

Click on "Create" to create the postgreSQL database instance.

Switch to the Topology view, you should see the PostgeSQL database deployed and running.

While this is happening we can go ahead and create a config map containing runtime variables for out EAP application.  

This config map contains non-sensitive information relating to the PostgreSQL connection connection such as the database service host and database name.  Sensitive information such as username / password will be pulled from the secrets created when these services where deployed.

To create the config map, click on "ConfigMaps" on the left menu and click on "Create ConfigMap".  From the "Create ConfigMap" page, select "YAML view" and paste the following text:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: eap-config
data: 
  # Configuration to connnect to PostgreSQL
  POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: postgresDB
  POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE: postgresql
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST: postgresql
