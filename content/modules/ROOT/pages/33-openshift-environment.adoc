= OpenShift Environment

The JBoss EAP application requires a connection to a PostgreSQL database.  Before we deploy our application on OpenShift we will need to deploy an instance of PostgreSQL.

== 1. PostgreSQL database setup

. Access the OpenShift console by clicking on the following {openshift_cluster_console_url}[link^] 
+
Login with the following credentials:
+
* *Username*: `{USER_ID}`
* *Password*: `openshift`
+
You should see the initial OpenShift developer UI screen.

. Click on "Skip Tour"
+
. *Switch to the project called "{USER_ID}-project"*
+

+
. Within this project, add a PostgreSQL database by clicking on "+Add" and selecting "Database" from the Developer catalog.

. From the Developer catalog, select the "PostgreSQL" template.

+
[source,sh]
----
* User name: postgresUser
* Password: postgresPW
* Database name: postgresDB
----

. Click on "Create" to create the postgreSQL database instance.

. Switch to the Topology view, you should see the PostgreSQL database deployed and running.

== 2. Config map

While our database is starting up we can go ahead and create a config map containing runtime variables for our EAP application.  

This config map contains non-sensitive information relating to the PostgreSQL connection connection such as the database service host and database name.  Sensitive information such as username / password will be pulled from the secrets created when these services were deployed.

. To create the config map, click on "ConfigMaps" on the left menu and click on "Create ConfigMap"

.  From the "Create ConfigMap" page, select "YAML view" and paste the following text:
+
[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: eap-config
data: 
  # Configuration to connnect to PostgreSQL
  POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: postgresDB
  POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE: postgresql
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST: postgresql
----

We can now move on to the deployment of our JBoss EAP 8.0 application to OpenShift.
