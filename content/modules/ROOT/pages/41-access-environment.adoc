== Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

. To get started, link:{devworkspaces_url}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] you will be presented with an option to login with your OpenShift credentials

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

=== Logging into the Openshift cluster using devspaces terminal

. Access the terminal in dev spaces by clicking on "Menu" -> "Terminal" -> "New Terminal"

include::partial$create-project.adoc[]

. *Switch to the project called "{USER_ID}-project"*
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
oc project {USER_ID}-project
----

. You should see an output similar to the one below
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
Using project "{USER_ID}-project" on server
----

. Since we'll be using multiple terminal sessions in this exercise (one for OpenShift and other for the VM). Let's rename this terminal tab to avoid confusion. Click on the `bash` icon as show below and select `Rename`option
+

. Your terminal should look something like this

=== Logging into the VM using devspaces terminal
. Create a new terminal window to log into the VM by clicking the split terminal icon
+
image::rhsi-split-terminal.png[rhsi-split-terminal]

. Rename newly created terminal window (the one to the right). Right click on the `bash` icon as show below and select `Rename`option
+
image::rhsi-rename-vm.png[rhsi-rename-vm]

. Rename it to `VM` and hit enter
+
image::rhsi-enter-vm.png[rhsi-enter-vm]

. Your terminal should look something like this
+
image::rhsi-terminal.png[rhsi-terminal]

. Login to the VM using this newly created terminal tab+
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 {bastion_ssh_user_name}@{bastion_public_hostname}
----

. Enter the following password to login
+
*Password:* `{bastion_ssh_password}`

. If the login has been successful you should be logged in as `lab-user` on the VM
