== Test-driven migration 

The code migration done so far simply enables the new _Camel Quarkus_ application to perform a minimal request/response interaction using the _OpenApi_ contract. It is still however pending to include all the business logic from our old _Fuse_ project.

The code to migrate is not trivial. It's advisable to find a good strategy forward that helps making progress with confidence. The _Fuse_ project has a robust and well implemented Junit. Let's take advantage of it and start migrating the old Junit to its new version which will help validating the migration work.

[NOTE]
--
- You may often find in other migration projects that unit testing is missing or not provided. Often unit testing is not embedded within the project and belongs to other organisational groups (i.e. testing teams).
- In such situations, it is most recommended to include in the scope of the migration process the creation of Junit testing to improve the overall quality of the code and, thinking medium and long term, guarantee minimal maintenance costs.
--

Let's look at the unit test included in the _Fuse_ project and understand how effective the _Camel_ testing framework is to help us validate our implementation.

The diagram below illustrates the strategy of the _Camel_ junit you will be migrating:

image::test-unit.png[align="center", width=80%]

In the picture above observe the following elements:

- At the center you can see the main _Camel_ on _Quarkus_ project under test.
- Left (client) and right (HTTP and SOAP backends) you can see the external agents intended to interact with the system.
- The test unit diverts and simulates the interaction with clients and servers.
+
--
. It triggers the client request.
. It captures the backend traffic and validates its data
. It simulates the backend responses, both for REST and SOAP.
. It waits for the system's final response to the client.
. It validates the response and runs extra assertions.
--

In the sections that follow you will adopt a test-driven approach using the Junit described to continue migrating the _Fuse_ project.

{empty} +


We intend in this section to migrate the region of code that integrates with the REST endpoint.

As hinted in the previous section, the plan is to adopt a test-driven approach, and start by migrating a portion of the _Fuse_ Junit that will help ensuring it meets the functional expectations.

The most significant difference between the original _Fuse_ Junit and the new one for _Camel Quarkus_ is the use of the _Camel_ test support class.

- For _Blueprint_ (_Fuse on Karaf_) projects you define test units as follows:
+
----
public class ServiceTest extends CamelBlueprintTestSupport {
----

- For _Camel_ on _Quarkus_ projects you declare your unit test as:
+
----
@QuarkusTest
public class ServiceTest extends CamelQuarkusTestSupport {
----


We've created a skeleton to accelerate the migration of the test unit. You only need to fill up the most relevant parts. You'll notice that the original code from _Fuse_, for the most part, is kept as-is with minor differences.


Open the following Java file from your _Camel Quarkus_ project:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/test/java/org/camel/example/ServiceTest.java*

Now follow the steps described below:

Migrate from _Fuse_ the mock servers defined in the Junit as indicated.

. Find in your _Camel Quarkus_ project the region of code with the following declaration:
+
----
    @Override
    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() throws Exception {

                // COPY/PASTE HERE the embedded Camel routes
            }
        };
    }
----

. Include the following code where it says `COPY/PASTE HERE ...`:

                //Quarkus random server port requires to reconfigure endpoints
                reconfigureEndpoints();  // <1>

                rest("/unit/test")
                    .post("/subscriber/details")
                    .to("direct:backend-rest");

                from("direct:backend-rest")
                    .id("backend-rest-listener")
                    .to("mock:backend-rest")
                    .to("language:constant:resource:classpath:rest/response.json");

                from("cxf:bean:s1")
                    .id("backend-soap-listener")
                    .setBody().simple("${body[0]}")
                    .to("mock:backend-soap")
                    .log("Stub got request: ${body}")

The embedded Camel routes above implement the REST and SOAP mock backends you saw earlier in the diagram:

image::test-unit-mocks.png[align="center", width=20%]

You can now focus your attention on the main test unit named `testServiceGetDetails()`.

You will complete its implementation in stages. First, let's validate the processing logic sending traffic to the first endpoint (REST backend). Later you will validate also the call to the SOAP endpoint.

. Find in your _Camel Quarkus_ project the region of code with the following declaration:

You have now a minimal JUnit. Run it with the command below:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
./mvnw clean test

Not surprisingly you should see your test unit fail with the following error messages:
----

The error above (`Expected: <1> but was: (0)`) is telling you the mock (REST) server never got called by _Camel_. This is only normal because you haven't migrated yet the _Camel_ route invoking the REST backend.

You can visually check, by scrolling up in your terminal, how _Camel_ printed out (log actions) dummy messages instead of performing outbound calls:
----
...
[timestamp] ... dummy call-system1 (to be removed)
[timestamp] ... dummy call-system2 (to be removed)
...
----

However, the test allows you to validate the following bullet points:

* The JUnit is successfully calling the exposed REST service `/camel/subscriber/details`
* The main route you have migrated is properly executing.
* By failing, the junit is letting you know the functionality to invoke the REST endpoint is still not complete.

{empty} +

Let's work on the code and make the Junit succeed !

{empty} +

#### REST endpoint

Let's migrate the `call-system1` _Camel_ route that contains the integration logic with the REST endpoint.

In summary, the route prepares and sends a JSON request to the backend and obtains a response that is lodged in a process variable (_Exchange_ property).

Open in _Camel Quarkus_ the file containing the _Camel_ definitions, located at:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/main/resources/routes/api-medium.xml*

Find in your template the following definition (empty):
----
    <route id="call-system1">
      <from uri="direct:call-system1"/>
      <!-- COPY/PASTE DEFINITION HERE -->
      <log message="dummy call-system1 (to be removed)"/>
    </route>
----

Replace the line `<!-- COPY/PASTE DEFINITION HERE -->` with the snippet below:

[source,xml,role="copypaste"]
----
      <log message="calling Backend1 with: ${body}"/>

      <!-- CALL to BACKEND -->
      <removeHeaders pattern="*"/>
      <setHeader name="content-type">                  <!-- 1 -->
        <constant>application/json</constant>
      </setHeader>
      <to id="end1" uri="http:{{api.backend1.host}}{{api.backend1.path}}"/>

      <!-- BUFFERED RESPONSE to STRING -->
      <convertBodyTo type="String"/>                   <!-- 2,3 -->

      <!-- KEEP RESPONSE -->
      <setProperty name="subscriber-response-rest">    <!-- 4 -->
        <simple>${body}</simple>
      </setProperty>

      <log message="Backend1 is: ${exchangeProperty.subscriber-response-rest}"/>

NOTE: _Camel Quarkus_ can use out-of-box JSON to XML functionality from XSLT 3.0 and XPATH 3.0.
<3> The following conversion has been added:

The highlights of the _Camel_ route you just have migrated are collected in the list below:

. *Prepares and performs the call to the REST backend*.
. *Keeps the response in a process variable (Exchange property)*.

The sub-diagram shown below illustrates the implemented interaction:

Let's now rework the JUnit. +
As a reminder, the following line was included earlier in the lab:
----
reconfigureEndpoints();
----
NOTE: This new line was added because the mechanism to load testing configuration in _Camel Quarkus_ is different than _Karaf_ base tests.

It is time to include the necessary lines of code to reconfigure the call to point to the embedded REST server (test mock).

Edit again the test unit in your _Camel Quarkus_ project:

- *migration-fuse-camel-quarkus/migration/camelq/level2medium-soap_template/src/test/java/org/camel/example/ServiceTest.java*

And follow the steps indicated below:

. Find in your _Camel Quarkus_ project the region of code with the following declaration:
+
----
    private void reconfigureEndpoints() throws Exception {
        
        // COPY/PASTE HERE reconfiguration        
    }

        String host = "http://localhost:{{quarkus.http.test-port}}";

        //reconfigure REST endpoint <2>

          a.weaveById("end1").replace().to(host+"{{api.backend1.path}}");
        });

    protected String setConfigAdminInitialConfiguration(final Properties props) {
    	String restPort = Integer.toString(getRandomPort());
    	String soapPort = Integer.toString(getRandomPort());
        props.setProperty("rest.host",         "localhost");
        props.setProperty("rest.port",         restPort);
        props.setProperty("api.backend1.host", "localhost:"+restPort);
        props.setProperty("api.backend1.path", "/unit/test/subscriber/details");
        props.setProperty("api.backend2.host", "localhost:"+soapPort);
        return "demo.medium";
----
======

You have now completed the test unit checks and configurations to validate the integration with the REST endpoint.

Rerun the test unit with:

```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

This time around your Junit should pass and the following message should show:
----

So far, your Junit is succeeding to do the following checks:

* The JUnit is successfully calling the exposed REST service `/camel/subscriber/details`
* The main route calls the `call-system1` sub-route.
* The `call-system1` route prepares and sends a REST request.
* The REST mock server receives the JSON request.
* The JUnit captures the backend JSON request and validates its payload.
