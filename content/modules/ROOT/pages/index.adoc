== Introduction 
A customer is embarking on a modernization and cloud migration project, they've selected OpenShift to run containerized workloads on a Hyperscaler.  They are now planning to move applications from virtual machines located on in-house data centers to OpenShift.  These applications will be updated to use cloud-native technologies in the process.
In this scenario we will be discussing three different applications.

* A Red Hat Fuse application, which will be migrated to Red Hat build of Apache Camel Quarkus on OpenShift
* A JBoss EAP 7.4 application, which will be migrated to JBoss EAP 8.0 on OpenShift
* A legacy SOAP application, which will need to remain running on the in-house data center due to dependencies from other applications

As you can see from the existing architecture, all of these applications are deployed on a virtual machine on an internal subnet.

In this lab, you'll learn about capabilities recently introduced in JBoss EAP 8.0, both for developer and operations teams. You'll then get hands on, migrating an EAP 7.4 application from on-prem to the cloud with EAP 8.0 and OpenShift using the Migration Toolkit for Applications. You will also see how to migrate apps which depend on Fuse with Karaf to the Red Hat build of Apache Camel on OpenShift. Finally you will keep the service running even during extended migrations by easily and securely connecting the apps back to on-prem resources using Red Hat Service Interconnect.

The desired end state is as follows:
