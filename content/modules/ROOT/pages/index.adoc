Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**
