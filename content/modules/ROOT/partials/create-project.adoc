IMPORTANT: Throughout this lab we will be using a project called {USER_ID}-project.  You will need to create this project if you have not already done so.

If you have not already created this project you can do so now by entering the following from the terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
oc new-project {USER_ID}-project
----

You will see a response similar to

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
Now using project "{USER_ID}-project" on server "https://172.30.0.1:443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
